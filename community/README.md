# Community Subdomain Setup

This directory contains the placeholder community page for `community.momentvm.club`.

## Files:
- `CNAME` - Points the subdomain to `community.momentvm.club`
- `index.html` - The main community page (placeholder)
- `README.md` - This file

## How it works:
1. The `CNAME` file tells Netlify to serve this directory when someone visits `community.momentvm.club`
2. The `index.html` file serves as the landing page for the community
3. All styling and scripts are referenced from the parent directory (`../styles.css`, `../script.js`)

## Next steps:
When you're ready to build the actual community platform, you can:
1. Replace the placeholder content with your real community features
2. Add authentication and member-only areas
3. Integrate with your chosen community platform (Circle, Discord, etc.)
4. Add real-time features like chat, forums, etc.

## Current status:
✅ Subdomain configured  
✅ Placeholder page created  
✅ Navigation links added to main site  
✅ Consistent styling maintained
